# PSP-docking-station


*not everything on the model is 100% accurate* 


To start this project you need to buy:


https://ebay.us/m/LCZKMi


https://ebay.us/m/g2EdaJ (required for hdmi output)


https://ebay.us/m/XsO4d7 



You need to do three modifications to the items you just bought. The usb-c to psp adapter needs to be trimmed where the ac power meets the base. The Av connector that part where the psp meets it will need to be stripped of its outer coating. Lastly the AV2HDMi converter will have to be deshelled. (holes on model does not account for mini av2hdmi because I don't have access to it). With your 3d printed dock start inserting the parts. You may have to trim some holes so parts can fit effectively.
